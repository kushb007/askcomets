# Inspiration
Sometimes, finding help for a specific problem for a class might be hard, especially with all the avenues you can look to, such as discord or other sites such as StackOverflow. We wanted to make a centralized form of question help in which comets from all different classes can ask and help others with questions.

# What it does
The website allows users to upload their own questions based on the class they are in and others can, in turn, answer them. We will display questions based on how recent they are.

# How we built it
We used flask/python to develop the backend of our code (the database of questions) and react.js to connect the backend to the frontend and we also used it to develop the frontend itself.

# Challenges we ran into
We had trouble requesting our backend API and some trouble with some frontend react issues.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our backend works pretty well, compared to what we expected

# What we learned
We learned to use flask to develop a backend and also learned how to implement it to a frontend made from React

# What's next for AskComets
We plan on implementing a priority system along with points for users for answering questions
